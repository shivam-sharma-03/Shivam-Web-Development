While using my Service, I may ask you to provide me with certain personally identifiable information that can be used to contact or identify you ("Personal Data"). Personally identifiable information may include, but is not limited to:

* Email address

### Usage Data

I may also collect information that your browser sends whenever you visit my Service or when you access Service by or through any device ("Usage Data").

This Usage Data may include information such as your computer's Internet Protocol address (e.g., IP address), browser type, browser version, the pages of my Service that you visit, the time and date of your visit, the time spent on those pages, unique device identifiers, and other diagnostic data.

When you access Service with a device, this Usage Data may include information such as the type of device you use, your device unique ID, the IP address of your device, your device operating system, the type of Internet browser you use, unique device identifiers, and other diagnostic data.

### Location Data

I do not actively collect or store precise location data. Your IP address may provide a general geographical location (country, city), but this is part of standard Usage Data and not used to track your specific whereabouts.

### Tracking & Cookies Data

I use cookies and similar tracking technologies to track activity on my Service and I hold certain information.

**Cookies** are small files with a small amount of data which may include an anonymous unique identifier. Cookies are sent to your browser from a website and stored on your device. Other tracking technologies are also used such as beacons, tags, and scripts to collect and track information and to improve and analyze my Service.

You can instruct your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, if you do not accept cookies, you may not be able to use some portions of my Service effectively.

Examples of Cookies I may use:

* **Session Cookies:** I use Session Cookies to operate my Service.

### Other Data

I generally do not collect sensitive personal data such as sex, age, date of birth, place of birth, passport details, citizenship, or financial information through this Web Development website unless explicitly provided by you as part of a project discussion, which would then be subject to separate agreements. The primary data collected is for contact and service inquiry purposes.

## 7. Transfer of Data

Your information, including Personal Data, may be transferred to – and maintained on – computers located outside of your state, province, country, or other governmental jurisdiction where the data protection laws may differ from those of your jurisdiction.

If you are located outside India and choose to provide information to me, please note that I am based in India and may transfer the data, including Personal Data, to India and process it there.

Your consent to this Privacy Policy followed by your submission of such information represents your agreement to that transfer.

I will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy, and no transfer of your Personal Data will take place to an organization or a country unless there are adequate controls in place, including the security of your data and other personal information.

## 9. Security of Data

The security of your data is important to me. However, remember that no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While I strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Data, I cannot guarantee its absolute security.

## 10. Your Data Protection Rights Under General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)

If you are a resident of the European Union (EU) and European Economic Area (EEA), you have certain data protection rights, covered by GDPR.

I aim to take reasonable steps to allow you to correct, amend, delete, or limit the use of your Personal Data.

If you wish to be informed what Personal Data I hold about you and if you want it to be removed from my systems, please contact me by email at **[Your Email Address, e.g., contact@ShivamsWeb Development.com]**.

---

## 11. Your Data Protection Rights under the California Online Privacy Protection Act (CalOPPA)

CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to post a privacy policy. The law's reach stretches well beyond California to require a person or company in the United States (and conceivably the world) that operates websites collecting personally identifiable information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and those individuals with whom it is being shared, and to comply with this policy.

According to CalOPPA, I agree to the following:

* Users can visit my site anonymously.
* My Privacy Policy link includes the word "Privacy" and can easily be found on the home page of my website.
* Users will be notified of any privacy policy changes on my Privacy Policy Page.
* Users are able to change their personal information by contacting me via email at **[Your Email Address, e.g., contact@ShivamsWeb Development.com]**.

**My Policy on "Do Not Track" Signals:**
I honor Do Not Track signals. I do not track, plant cookies, or use advertising when a Do Not Track browser mechanism is in place. Do Not Track is a preference you can set in your web browser to inform websites that you do not want to be tracked.

You can enable or disable Do Not Track by visiting the Preferences or Settings page of your web browser.

## 12. Your Data Protection Rights under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)

If you are a California resident, you are entitled to learn what data I collect about you, ask to delete your data, and not to sell (share) it. To exercise your data protection rights, you can make certain requests and ask me:

* **What personal information I have about you.** If you make this request, I will return to you:
    * The categories of personal information I have collected about you.
    * The categories of sources from which I collect your personal information.
    * The business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling your personal information.
    * The categories of third parties with whom I share personal information.
    * The specific pieces of personal information I have collected about you.
    * A list of categories of personal information that I have "sold," along with the category of any other company I "sold" it to. If I have not "sold" your personal information (as defined by CCPA), I will inform you of that fact.
    * A list of categories of personal information that I have disclosed for a business purpose, along with the category of any other company I shared it with.
    Please note, you are entitled to ask me to provide you with this information up to two times in a rolling twelve-month period. When you make this request, the information provided may be limited to the personal information I collected about you in the previous 12 months.
* **To delete your personal information.** If you make this request, I will delete the personal information I hold about you as of the date of your request from my records and direct any service providers to do the same. In some cases, deletion may be accomplished through de-identification of the information. If you choose to delete your personal information, you may not be able to use certain functions that require your personal information to operate.
* **To stop selling your personal information.** I do not sell or rent your personal information to any third parties for any purpose. I do not sell your personal information for monetary consideration. However, under some circumstances, a transfer of personal information to a third party, or within my family of companies, without monetary consideration may be considered a "sale" under California law. You are the only owner of your Personal Data and can request disclosure or deletion at any time.
    If you submit a request to stop "selling" your personal information, I will stop making such transfers.
    Please note, if you ask me to delete or stop "selling" your data, it may impact your experience with me, and you may not be able to participate in certain programs or services which require the usage of your personal information to function. But in no circumstances, I will discriminate against you for exercising your rights.
To exercise your California data protection rights described above, please send your request(s) by email to: **[Your Email Address, e.g., contact@ShivamsWeb Development.com]**.
Your data protection rights, described above, are covered by the CCPA, short for the California Consumer Privacy Act. To find out more, visit the official California Legislative Information website. The CCPA took effect on 01/01/2020 and was updated by CPRA taking effect on 01/01/2023.

## 13. Service Providers

I may employ third-party companies and individuals to facilitate my Service ("Service Providers"), provide Service on my behalf, perform Service-related services, or assist me in analyzing how my Service is used.
These third parties have access to your Personal Data only to perform these tasks on my behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for any other purpose. Examples include web hosting providers, analytics services (like Google Analytics), and potentially email communication services.

---

## 14. Analytics

I may use third-party Service Providers to monitor and analyze the use of my Service. For example, I use Google Analytics. Google Analytics collects data about your traffic via Google advertising cookies and anonymous identifiers. This includes data about how visitors use the website, where they came from, and what they looked at. This information helps me improve the website's functionality and user experience.

---

## 15. CI/CD Tools

I may use third-party Service Providers to automate the development and deployment process of my Service (e.g., GitHub, Vercel). These tools do not typically process your Personal Data directly as part of their CI/CD function.

---

## 16. Behavioral Remarketing

I do not currently engage in behavioral remarketing campaigns where I advertise on third-party websites based on your past visits to my Service using cookies. However, this policy will be updated if I implement such practices in the future.

---

## 17. Links to Other Sites

My Service may contain links to other sites that are not operated by me. If you click a third-party link, you will be directed to that third party's site. I strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of every site you visit.
I have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services.

---

## 18. Children's Privacy

My Services are not intended for use by children under the age of 18 ("Child" or "Children").
I do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from Children under 18. If you become aware that a Child has provided me with Personal Data, please contact me. If I become aware that I have collected Personal Data from Children without verification of parental consent, I take steps to remove that information from my servers.

---

## 19. Changes to This Privacy Policy

I may update my Privacy Policy from time to time. I will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.
I will let you know via a prominent notice on my Service (e.g., a banner or pop-up) if there are significant changes, prior to the change becoming effective, and update the "Effective Date" at the top of this Privacy Policy.
You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.
