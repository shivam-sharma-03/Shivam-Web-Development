**Effective Date:** June 22, 2025

## 1. Introduction

Thank you for considering or working with **Shivam's Web Development**.

If for any reason, you are not completely satisfied with a service, I invite you to review my policy on refunds and cancellations.

Please read and make sure you fully understand this policy prior to making a payment or commencing a project.

As a web development and design professional, I operate with the expectation that clients understand and respect my policies. My goal is to deliver the highest value for the investment made by my clients. To help me in this pursuit, I need to cover expenses and allocate my time and resources effectively. Therefore, I require payments to be made on time in respect to the services offered.

**THIS IS MY REFUND AND CANCELLATION POLICY. BY ENGAGING Shivam'S Web Development FOR SERVICES, YOU ARE BOUND BY THIS AGREEMENT AND YOU AGREE TO ABIDE BY MY POLICIES.**

## 2. Project Payments (Design & Web Development, etc.)

Design, web development, branding, UI/UX design, SEO, social media marketing, and other digital service projects require extensive resources, consume my dedicated time, and incur internal expenses. Therefore, once a payment or deposit is made, it is generally **non-refundable**.

* **Non-Refundable Payments:** Payments for design, development, or any of my services are non-refundable, even if a fee was paid in advance. Once a payment or deposit is made, there are generally no exceptions to this refund policy, as work often begins immediately upon receipt of payment.
* **Project Cancellation, Delay, or Postponement by Client:** If a project gets canceled, significantly delayed, or postponed by the client after payment, then all the amount paid will be retained by **Shivam's Web Development**. Additionally, if applicable, an additional cost will be charged to the client for all work completed beyond what was already paid for, based on the agreed-upon hourly rates or project milestones. No exceptions.
* **Setup Fees:** Any setup fees are applied directly to expenses incurred by Shivam's Web Development in the initial phase of any design, development, or marketing campaigns (e.g., software licenses, initial research, account setup) and are **non-refundable**.

## 3. Website Hosting & Maintenance Services

* **Hosting Payments:** All hosting payments (whether for current or past months) are generally **non-refundable**. Web hosting accounts are set up from the date of your order and are allotted specific server resources. If a client initiates a hosting account but does not actively use it, payment will still be due. Hosting billing cycles continue until a cancellation notice is received in writing from the client.
* **Account Suspension for Non-Payment:** Any hosting or maintenance payments that are 15 days past due will trigger an account suspension.
* **Cancellation of Annual Hosting:** For hosting paid up to 12 months in advance and canceled *before* the expiration date, a refund may be provided for the full, unused months not yet elapsed, minus any initial setup fees or third-party service costs already incurred.
* **Service Termination Due to Policy Violations:** **Shivam's Web Development** reserves the right to disable and/or terminate a userâ€™s account, services, or contract if a user is found in violation of my terms and policies (e.g., acceptable use, content guidelines). Termination due to policy violations will **not** be refunded.

## 4. Chargebacks and Payment Disputes

If any chargeback or payment dispute is initiated by a client to a bank or credit card company for services rendered, then client services and/or projects will be suspended immediately. In some cases, all work completed for the project may be undone (reversed) without further notice. Furthermore, the amount of the chargeback fee imposed by the bank will be re-issued to the client.

In addition, any outstanding balances accrued as a result of the chargeback(s) will have to be paid in full before I restore service, deliver any files, or commence any further work.

**PLEASE CONTACT ME DIRECTLY TO ADDRESS ANY BILLING ISSUES OR CONCERNS, AND I WILL GLADLY HELP YOU FIND A RESOLUTION.**

Requesting a chargeback or opening a dispute for a valid charge from me is considered a breach of this agreement. Chargebacks are generally not a legal or appropriate means of obtaining a refund for services rendered. All legitimate disputes will be challenged with sufficient evidence from my records.
